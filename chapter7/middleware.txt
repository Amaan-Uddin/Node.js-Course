middleware are request handlers with access to application's req-res cycle.
it holds the req object, the res object and the middleware function.

in express there are many built-in middleware and also we can define our own middleware.

Middleware functions can perform various tasks such as modifying the request or response 
objects, executing additional code, terminating the request-response cycle, or passing control 
to the next middleware function.

public folder contains all the static files which are called by the client 
executes files that can't be changed dynamically by the client and are static in nature

CORS, or cross origin resource sharing is a security measure which prevents any other program from accesing the 
data from the server. The data is only shared with applications on the same URL or Port.

If your frontend is on a different port and makes a request to your backend you end up with CORS Error
To overcome this we require the 'cors' module and we need to specify which URL or ROUTES have access to our 
data from the server.

we can create a whitelist for all the origins that have access 

const cors = require('cors')
app.use(cors({
    origin: https://localhost:3500
}))
