In this tutortial we learn about routing of client request and how we handle those using handlers (callbacks)

Express is a JS framerwork that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications
It helps with managing server and routes in Node.js
It is layered on top of Node.js to handle request and responses

a single route can have multiple route handlers and we chain then using next() function

NOTE: always keep your 404 calls at the very bottom on all other GET calls
