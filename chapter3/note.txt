npm - node package manager, has node modules made by 3rd party developers.

Essential npm knowledge:
-> to install packages in our directory we use 'npm' followed by 'install' and then the package name
-> npm install nodemon / npm i nodemon / npm add nodemon

-> nodemon is command line tool used to monitor a JS file. Once you make changes to a JS file it then 
   runs your node application in the terminal in real time.

   to install nodemon globally use;
   npm install nodemon -g

-> to initialize a node project we run the cmd
   npm init / npm init -y (the '-y' flag answers yes to all the question asked during the init process)

   we then have package.json in our file tree which has all the info about the project along with 
   all the necessary dependencies and devDependencies

-> dependencies are modules that are required in the project and that we install using npm like 'express' 'date-fns'
   devDependencies are all the tools required during the development of the project like 'nodemon' 

-> when ever we install a module using npm it get's stored in a seperate folder named 'node_modules'

-> 'npm install' will install all the modules present in the dependencies and devDependencies

-> the scripts tag in the package.json is executed during deployment and building of application and inside the 
   the script tag we have the "start" key which we can modefy and run "npm start"
   and "dev" key which currently runs "nodemon index.js" and the command is "npm run dev"

-> if you want to update or check for updates for your packages run 'npm update'

NOTE: to reduce disk usage all the packages are removed, to re-install them run 'npm install'
