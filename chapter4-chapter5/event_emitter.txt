chapter4
creating a function that prints out the date,time,uuid and message when an event is emmited with the help 
of the 'events' common-core module

-> create a function that logs all the required parameters when an event is emitted and also saves the log
   in a seperate folder named 'logs'.
-> for this we need a object that listens/waits for an event and calls the logs function when a specific
   event is emitted.
